# EasyApi
A project to get started using web API's in Java

Created this project so my brother could work with a project that supports real world applications.

The project has some command processing already setup along with support for LIFX light control. 
There are HTTP methods handled by a singleton class `HttpMethods` and examples of how to use them in the `Lifx` class.
